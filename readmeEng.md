# LeetCode.com Task Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to tasks from LeetCode.com.

## **About the project**
LeetCode.com is one of the most popular online services for technical interview preparation in IT companies. It offers over 1,000 problems on algorithms and data structures that cover a wide range of topics such as strings, arrays, trees, graphs, and more.

In this repository, I have posted my solutions to the problems I solved in preparation for the interviews. Each directory corresponds to one problem, and it contains a file with a name that corresponds to the name of the problem that contains my Java solution.

## **How to use**
If you want to see my problem solution, go to the appropriate directory and open the file with the name corresponding to the problem name. In the file you will find my Java solution, as well as comments and explanations of why I chose this approach.

## **How to contribute**
If you want to contribute to this repository, you can do so by creating a new directory with a name that corresponds to the problem name and placing your solution in it. In doing so, please add comments and an explanation of why you chose this approach.

If you have a solution to a problem from [LeetCode.com](http://leetcode.com/) that is not in this repository, or if you have an improved solution to a problem that is already in the repository, please create a pull request. We welcome all contributions and are happy to include your solution in the repository.

## **Theory**
For solving problems on algorithms and data structures, it is useful to know the basic algorithms for sorting, searching, hashing, and to know basic data structures such as arrays, lists, trees, graphs, etc. In each file with my solution, I tried to add comments and explanations of why I chose this approach and how it works. I also tried to add links to additional information and materials for learning about the topic.
